# Keycap-Identifier
Image Processing to Recognize Keycap Sets

This is a personal project utilizing Tensorflow, Keras, Anaconda, and the suite of other supporting applications in order to identify keyboard keycap sets.

This is a Flutter application that uses a trained TF model to pass images to the model to analyze against a collection of keycap data and recognize what set the given image is.

Currently, the TF doesn't interact with the app and are two separate pieces, but as these continue to be worked on, it will become one cohesive project.
